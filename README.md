# Running Spark Locally using Docker Compose

Based on [karl chris/spark-docker](https://karlchris.github.io/data-engineering/projects/spark-docker/).

1. Start the cluster

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

2. Log in to the master node

    ```bash
    docker exec -it spark-master /bin/bash
    ```

3. Launch PySpark

    ```bash
    # shell of the pyspark master node in docker container
    pyspark
    ```

4. The link will be shown. Click on it to get to the web version of Jupyter

    ```log
    http://127.0.0.1:8889/tree?token=...
    ```

Cluster services are now available locally in the host machine browser:

- <http://localhost:8080> - WebUI of the master node.
  - Workers must be visible and accessible.
  - The current jupyter process should be represented as an active *PySparkSession*. It should be assigned workers and cores.
- <http://localhost:18080> - history-node.
  - The history of jobs.
  - View logs and statistics on resources for each launch of the *Application* (*SparkSession*).
